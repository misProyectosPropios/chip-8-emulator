# Introduction to Chip-8-emulator

This project is a project to implement an emulator of an emulator of a chip-8 architecture. 

The programming language selected to make it is C.

It will be developed using TDD.

All architecture and design decisions will be explained in the docs if they are not obvious.

For the testing, I will use CUnit documentation because of its simplicity to write tests.
